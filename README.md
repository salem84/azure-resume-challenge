# Azure Resume Challenge
#### 'A Cloud Guru' challenge

Hi guys üëãüëãüëã

this is the repository for my first [A Cloud Guru Challenge](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-your-resume-in-azure) to create a web resume using Azure infrastructure!

The site url is [www.giorgiolasala.space](https://www.giorgiolasala.space).

Thanks to all users in Discord "A Cloud Guru" channel and [Amen.pt](https://www.amen.pt/) for the free domain used in this challenge! üôèüôè

## Infrastructure as Code
In order to manage Azure infrastructure resources, I have used a template based on Bicep, that provides a transparent abstraction of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

In our use-case:

![Diagram](img/diagram.png)

Bicep template is composed of following resources:
* _CosmosDb_ (Account, database, container)
* _Storage Account_ 
* _Function_ with Consumption Plan
* _Application Insights_

A Bicep template could be easily deployed to an Azure Resource Group using Azure CLI 

```
az deployment group create --resource-group AZURE_RESOURCEGROUP_NAME --template-file BICEP_TEMPLATE
```

Unfortunately some configuration cannot be directly applied from _Bicep/ARM_ deployment template, such as _Static Website configuration_.
But... üöÄ GitHub Workflows are the rescue!

Moreover in order to create workflows completely indipendent from specific resource names, I have exported some output variables from Bicep template itself to be used directly in GitHub Workflow.

Indeed, at the begininnig of Bicep template, resource names are "randomized", generating a deterministic unique string based on Resource Group name:

```
param appName string = uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)
```

and at the end of file, there are all exported values used during deployment phase; in particular I have:
* _StorageAccountName_ to deploy resume static files after NuxtJs build
* _FunctionUrl_ to deploy Azure Function
* _Cdn_ information to purge after deployment

### Azure Deployment button
During creation of Bicep template, I have learned that Azure Button can be attached only to ARM templates. Maybe this issue will be solved in the future (Bicep templates are quite young :) ), but in the meantime I have created a [CI build](.github/workflows/bicep.yml) that generates automatically ARM template and a ü§ñ GitHub Bot user commits JSON file directly into the repository.

Finally, it's possible to link Json ARM file to a Deployment button such as:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsalem84%2Fazure-resume-challenge%2Fmaster%2Fdeploy%2Fmain.json)

This button is not needed for Azure Resume challenge project, but however I would like sharing this 'pork-around' üê∑!

## GitHub Workflow
Under _workflows_ folder there are 3 pipelines:
1. [_bicep.yml_](.github/workflows/bicep.yml):  to create ARM file for Azure Deploy. 

    After install Bicep build tools
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Install Bicep build
      run: | 
        curl -Lo bicepinstall https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
        chmod +x ./bicepinstall
        sudo mv ./bicepinstall /usr/local/bin/bicep
        bicep --help
    ```
    
    this workflow generates a JSON file 
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Run Bicep build
      run: |
        bicep build deploy/*.bicep
    ```

    and commits to repository using [Add & Commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit) GitHub Action:

    ```yaml
    - uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7.0.0
      with:
        author_name: github-actions
        author_email: 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
        message: 'Update Bicep-ARM template'
        add: 'deploy/*.json'
    ```

2. [_ci.yml_](.github/workflows/bicep.yml): to lint Typescript source files

    ```yaml
     - name: Run linter üëÄ
       run: npm run lint
    ```

3. [_build_deploy.yml_](.github/workflows/bicep.yml): manual workflow to deploy function and site.  

Last workflow is composed of _three_ jobs, splitted in _two_ phases

<IMAGE_GH>

- Azure Infrastructure
    - Deploy Azure Template job
- Azure Code
    - Azure Function job
    - Nuxt job



## Azure Function
Azure Function is developed in C# using _CosmosDb_ bindings to write a simple record and tracking visitor.
In particular I have used two bindings (maybe uesd only one of these?):
* _IAsyncCollector<CounterStatsItem>_ : to create a new document
* _DocumentClient_ : to count all visitors in CosmosDb container

Moreover I have attached _Application Insights_ for logging and monitoring:

## Resume Template

Resume template is based on beautiful resume NuxtJs code developed by [Ivan Greve](https://github.com/ivangreve/nuxt-resume) and [StartBootstrap Theme](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume/).

I developed a custom Vue component ([source](resume/components/Counter.vue)) in order to do an HTTP request to Azure Function and show a Toast notification using [@nuxtjs/toast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/toast) plugin.

## Conclusion

### What are your biggest takeaways
This challenge was the opportunity to start with new technologies and to go deeper with others.
It was the first time I have used Bicep template and NuxtJs framework, two very interesting technologies and at the same time I have played with CDN and Azure Static WebSite!

As regards Bicep templates, in the past I have used different IaC frameworks, but this time I was surprised to see Microsoft documentation (for each ARM code in Microsoft site there is the equivalent Bicep template) and to find many examples on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/tree/main/docs/examples).

Instead as regards NuxtJs, I have learned only some basic concept and I would like to broaden my knowledge about it.

Surely the most important "lesson learned" was the opportunity to orchestrate all these technologies using GitHub workflows!

### What was the hardest part?
During development of all services I have encountered some challenging parts:
* _Testing GitHub pipeline_: to be sure it works correctly, all changes must be committed; I have read about [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) project, but I haven't success to start it locally... surely I will investigate about this choice.
* _CDN and domain configuration_: I have never used CDN, so I have found some issues to check if it's correctly works (why obtain 404 response? purge works?). Also CDN TLS configuration is quite confused to troubleshoot. Finally, I switched from Akamai to Microsoft CDN to support purge all easily
